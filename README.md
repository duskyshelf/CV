## David Upsdale

Forgive me, this is a working progress. I'm having too much fun doing tech tests at the moment...

A gamer who grew up in the arcades of London and in love with the current eSports scene. Moving on from a long running digital marketing career in order to express myself in the coding universe. Hoping to work on new and exciting projects that can test my skills.
