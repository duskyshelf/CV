## Experience

### Photobox (Feb 2019 - Dec 2022)

Originally joining as part of a frontend optimisation team, I grew to become involved in various core projects architecting and creating full stack applications for the business.

- Architecture - I was tasked to create numerous services for photobox. With both backend data APIs and fullstack internal applications to aid in their management. Most applications used a combination of Serverless and Typescript as well as Node/Cloudformation where appropriate. I designed with a high code quality mindset as they were applications which many teams and developers would need to continue to work on as part of the long term plans for the company.
- Frontend - All frontend applications at Photobox relied on React and GraphQL at their cores. Working with both Redux and Apollo clients to help manage data on the front-end. I also introduced Typescript to new applications as part of a company-wide move towards the language.
- Backend - The majority of backend services I worked on were developed to help handle the large product data sets in the company. Technology stacks were a mix of Node/Lambda/GraphQL/REST depending on the use cases.

### Trainline (June 2016 - Jan 2019)

Trainline was my first role after graduating Makers Academy, going from a front end focused junior to a fullstack software engineer within my team (Vulcan). Working primarily with the marketing teams, we handled the creation and management of large scale content pages covering different purposes and data sources.

#### Broader Skills

My marketing experience has been useful with regards to SEO discussions as it has remained relevent and practical when considering solutions to the problems we faced.
