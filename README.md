## Experience

#### Trainline (June 2016 - Present)

Trainline has been my first role since graduating Makers Academy, going from a front end focused junior to a fullstack software engineer within my team (named Vulcan). Working primarily with the marketing teams, Vulcan's role required of the creation and management of large scale content pages covering different purposes and data sources. This covered multiple applications

- Architecture - My domain knowledge within the team has meant I have been able both influence and architect a number of our applications. My most recent application being a Node/Bull job manager built to handle the complex scheduled data fetching we rely on for our static SEO pages.
- Frontend - The main challenge within Vulcan has been how to develop and maintain static and dynamic content pages across multiple applications at scale. As a developer, this has involved working in a React heavy environment utilising important concepts like performance, accessibility and SEO markup.
- Backend - With the prominence of JS developers in Vulcan, we have been able to include more node services to support our front end applications. I have been working across multiple apps from simple APIs to greenfield data services, working with both internal and external teams to deliver important features.
- Agile - Vulcan has had a strong focus on agile processes, involving stand-ups, retros and developer involvement in design processes. This has evolved heavily as the team has shrunk and grown and I am keen to experience new ways to solve common development problems.

#### Broader Skills

My marketing experience has been useful with regards to SEO discussions as it has remained relevent and practical when considering solutions to the problems we faced.
