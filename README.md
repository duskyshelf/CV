## David Upsdale

An up and coming software developer who loves gaming and all things tech. After working in digital marketing roles for the last few years, I realised my real passion was for creating rather than measuring. I'm looking for a role which challenges me and lets me get to grips with new technologies and concepts. Ideally I would be working as part of an agile team that prides itself on its ability to create expertly crafted software.


#### Problem Solving

Coming from a mathematical background, I enjoy finding logical and simple solutions to problems. This extends from basic logic to piecing together complex applications.

#### Agile Working

I have worked in agile teams in previous job roles, using Kanban and running regular stand ups. During my time at Makers Academy I built on that experience to improve my processes and expand my approach to development.

#### New Tech

I consider myself to be a fast learner when it comes to any new piece of tech, a skill I developed through a childhood of board games and video games, but honed working in an evolving digital marketing career.
- I have worked with numerous different marketing technologies including Google Ads, Google Analytics,
  Bing Ads, Facebook Ads, MediaMath, Unica, Marin, DoubleClick... New technology was being released every other month and I had to understand them extremely quickly. Being an early adopter and quickly becoming proficient made it possible to keep a competitive edge.
- I am always looking to work with interesting coding tech and enjoy finding the potential and limits of any new tools I find.

#### Broader Skills

I worked across numerous fields during my digital marketing career. I have worked with many companies in both internal and external roles and have a wide range of experience to draw on.

Some of the projects I've worked on include:
- Carried out proof of concepts for new startups, looking for their target markets and demonstrating where they can be financially viable.
- Analytics measuring the performance of in-house campaigns, external agencies, product lines, content creation and new marketing platforms.
- Performed SEO reviews for companies in both in-house and agency roles.
- Reported and presented to clients as both a consultant and primary agency contact.
