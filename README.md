## David Upsdale

An up-and-coming software developer who loves gaming and all things tech. After working in digital marketing roles for the last few years, I realised my real passion was for creating rather than measuring. I'm looking for a role that challenges me and lets me get to grips with new technologies and concepts. Ideally I would be working as part of a dynamic team that prides itself on its ability to create quality software.


#### Coding craftsmanship

Coming from a mathematical background, I enjoy finding logical and simple solutions to problems.
- I love creating clean, functional business logic. Here is one example of clean, simple code I wrote which I am particularly proud of:
https://github.com/duskyshelf/bowling-challenge - Pure Javascript ten-pin bowling business logic.  

- I have also developed a good understanding of architecture that allows me to pull together different branches of code to build increasingly complex apps. During my final project for Makers Academy I took responsibility for fitting together the various pieces of logic to complete the project. I was very happy with the result of our hard work, linked here:
https://github.com/duskyshelf/ispy-game - Final project at Makers Academy. Built using Ionic.  

#### Agile Working

I would like to work somewhere I can build on my experience of the Agile philosophy in action. In my previous roles I have worked in small development teams, and enjoyed using Kanban and running regular stand ups. At Factory Media some examples of our successes are:
- porting numerous legacy websites from their differing brands onto a single platform
- implementing changes quickly so that we were able to focus on testing and optimisation despite working with limited resources
- MORE

#### New Tech

I love learning to use new technologies. Both at Makers Academy and whilst working in an evolving digital marketing space, I learned to be a fast learner. Some ways this has helped me in my career include:

- Being an early adopter and quickly becoming proficient in of ***** TECH **** SOLID EXAMPLE
- I worked with Facebook Ads and the Turn DSP early on, before the market had time to fully develop. At that time they were extremely profitable and being able to pick them up quickly meant I could keep a competitive edge in ****SOMETHING****
- A sample of the numerous different marketing technologies I've worked with include: Google Ads, Google Analytics,
  Bing Ads, Facebook Ads, MediaMath, Turn, Unica, Marin, DoubleClick, Kenshoo...  
- At Makers Academy I was curious to learn new technologies beyond what was required on the course. For example I learned to use Ionic, ******** and continue to learn ******.

#### Team work

Both in my previous roles and at Makers Academy I have learned to be a good team player. Although I am able to work independently, I really enjoy working with on team projects. I am comfortable taking the lead when that seems appropriate, but also like to learn from the ideas of my team members. In my role at **COMPANY***, I worked closely with clients, presenting and reporting to them regularly. I consider myself to be a clear and effective communicator, and my teammates at Makers Academy said they really enjoyde working with me, which is encouraging.

#### Broader Skills

I bring a wider understanding of the tech industry in my approach to programming work, drawing from my experience in digital marketing. Some of the work I most enjoyed includes:
- Carrying out proof of concepts for new startups, looking for their target markets and demonstrating where they can be financially viable. During one of the most interesting projects I handled, I was able to highlight to a new scrap car company where their *** WHAT *** coverage was poor and where they needed to develop their network of dealerships in order to grow, given just a cost-per-acquisition with no other remits.
- Working with companies to introduce analytics to measure the performance of in-house campaigns, external agencies, product lines, content creation and new marketing platforms. The benefits of a focus on data over traditional processes was more often than not a new concept for the companies I worked with. By improving their data focus I was able to help companies allocate resources more efficiently.
