## David Upsdale

An up-and-coming software developer who loves gaming and all things tech. After working in digital marketing roles for the last few years, I realised my real passion was for creating rather than measuring. I'm looking for a role that challenges me and lets me get to grips with new technologies and concepts. Ideally I would be working as part of a dynamic team that prides itself on its ability to create quality software.


#### Problem Solving

Coming from a mathematical background, I enjoy finding logical and simple solutions to problems. During my time at Makers Academy I found these skills extended from a general affinity for clean, functional business logic to being able to piece together larger team projects as they grew more complex and discordant. During my final project for Makers Academy I found myself at the center of operations, using my understanding of the architecture to pull together the different branches of code at critical points to complete the project.

For both ends of the spectrum I want to highlight 2 repos I am particularly proud of:  
Clean simple code: https://github.com/duskyshelf/bowling-challenge - Pure Javascript ten-pin bowling business logic.  
Building and connecting a large project: https://github.com/duskyshelf/ispy-game - Final project at Makers Academy. Built using Ionic.  

#### Agile Working

I have worked in small development teams in previous job roles, using Kanban and running regular stand ups. This experience has helped in understanding different sides of the development process and has given me an appreciation for the Agile philosophy in action. At Factory Media we were a dedicated 5 person team tasked with porting the numerous legacy websites from their differing brands onto a single platform. Being able to implement quick changes meant that we could still focus on testing and optimisation despite working with limited resources.

#### New Tech

Working in an evolving digital marketing space, I've had to become a fast learner when it comes to new technologies.

New technology was being released every other month and I had to understand them extremely quickly. Being an early adopter and quickly becoming proficient made it possible to keep a competitive edge. This shone when it came to working with new platforms like Facebook Ads and the Turn DSP, as they were extremely profitable before the market had time to fully develop and rewarded those that were quick to pick up on the nuances of their systems.

- A sample of the numerous different marketing technologies I've worked with include: Google Ads, Google Analytics,
  Bing Ads, Facebook Ads, MediaMath, Turn, Unica, Marin, DoubleClick, Kenshoo...  

#### Broader Skills

I worked across numerous fields during my digital marketing career. I have worked with many companies in both internal and external roles and have a wide range of experience to draw on.

Some of the skills I developed include:
- Carried out proof of concepts for new startups, looking for their target markets and demonstrating where they can be financially viable. Paid marketing was important to these companies as they wouldn't have established brands and would usually be entering competitive marketplaces. One of the most interesting projects I handled involved kick starting a new scrap car company given just a cost-per-acquisition with no other remits. With the use of careful location targeting it proved both profitable and scalable. It also highlighted to the company where their coverage was poor and where they needed to develop their network of dealerships in order to grow.

- Analytics measuring the performance of in-house campaigns, external agencies, product lines, content creation and new marketing platforms. The benefits of a focus on data over traditional processes was more often than not a new concept for the companies I worked with. Improving their data focus usually resulted in more efficient resource allocation as they grew to understand the impacts of any changes they were making.
