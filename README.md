## David Upsdale

An up-and-coming software developer who loves gaming and all things tech. After working in digital marketing roles for the last few years, I realised my real passion was for creating rather than measuring. I'm looking for a role that challenges me and lets me get to grips with new technologies and concepts. Ideally I would be working as part of an agile team that prides itself on its ability to create expertly crafted software.
> Agile is a philosophy, not a methodology - so be careful when you use the word. Do you mean a team following Agile principles? If so, you may mean a Scrum Team or an XP Team, which are applications of the Agile philosophy. Also, you've only being doing this for a few months: you don't know what 'expertly crafted software' is - tone it down a bit ;)


#### Problem Solving

Coming from a mathematical background, I enjoy finding logical and simple solutions to problems. This extends from basic logic to piecing together complex applications.
> Prove it.

#### Agile Working

I have worked in agile teams in previous job roles, using Kanban and running regular stand ups. During my time at Makers Academy I built on that experience to improve my processes and expand my approach to development.
> There's that agile-with-a-small-a again! Also, so what? What did your Agile working lead to? Why should I hire you because of this?

#### New Tech

I consider myself to be a fast learner when it comes to any new piece of tech
> DON'T CARE what *you think* - prove it.

, a skill I developed through a childhood of board games and video games
> That's not proof, that's a story. Stop telling stories and give me evidence.

, but honed working in an evolving digital marketing career.
- I have worked with numerous different marketing technologies including Google Ads, Google Analytics,
  Bing Ads, Facebook Ads, MediaMath, Unica, Marin, DoubleClick... New technology was being released every other month and I had to understand them extremely quickly. Being an early adopter and quickly becoming proficient made it possible to keep a competitive edge.

> Again, you're telling me about things you used, rather than things you did / created / affected / increased / etc. What did you achieve with all these tools and what was the benefit of the 'competitive edge' you mention?

- I am always looking to work with interesting coding tech and enjoy finding the potential and limits of any new tools I find.

> So what?

#### Broader Skills

I worked across numerous fields during my digital marketing career. I have worked with many companies in both internal and external roles and have a wide range of experience to draw on.
> Another story - ask yourself what the point of this sentence is. If this was the only sentence you were allowed to send to an employer, how would you improve it?

Some of the projects I've worked on include:
- Carried out proof of concepts for new startups, looking for their target markets and demonstrating where they can be financially viable.
> Be more specific! Evidence! Which startups, what were they doing, how did you help? Did you demonstrate financial viability for any of them, did it make a difference to their strategy?

- Analytics measuring the performance of in-house campaigns, external agencies, product lines, content creation and new marketing platforms.

> To what end? What happened when you 'worked on analytics engines'? Did your performance affect the running of the companies you were analysing?

- Performed SEO reviews for companies in both in-house and agency roles.

> You get the point now: what happened when you did these reviews? Did they improve their SEO as a result? Did they make more money?

- Reported and presented to clients as both a consultant and primary agency contact.

> So what?
